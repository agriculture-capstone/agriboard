Agriboard is an administrative dashboard for the agriculture software stack.
It is used to manage users and view advanced analytics.

== Running Using Docker

The repository can be run with docker and not installing any other dependencies.
The `dockerize.sh` script has been made for this purpose.
The `./dockerize.sh` script can be used with the following arguments:

* `init` - creates a Docker image based on the Dockerfile
* `build` - installs the node modules and build the project using `npm run build`
* `run` - installs the node modules and starts a development web server at `<docker_ip>:8080`
== Dependencies

. link:https://nodejs.org/en/[NodeJS] (version 8.9.0 or higher) is the base framework

. link:https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/[Yarn] installs/manages all other dependencies

To install all other dependencies, run `yarn`

IMPORTANT: Please use yarn to manage your dependencies.

=== Using Yarn

*The following commands should never be used in this repository.*

* `npm install`
* `npm install <package>`
* `npm install --dev <package>`
* `npm remove <package>`

The following should be used instead.

* `yarn`
* `yarn add <package>`
* `yarn add --dev <package>`
* `yarn remove <package>`

== Development

To start developing, run:

	npm start

And navigate to `localhost:8080` in a browser.

Hot reloading is enabled, so the server does not needed to be restarted or the any page reloaded when changes are made.
Any changes will automatically propogate to the browser while maintaining the previous state of agriboard.

=== Style Guide

Agriboard adheres to the link:https://github.com/airbnb/javascript[AirBnB] style guide.
Read over this briefly to understand the reasoning behind the linting rules.

=== Tests

To perform a single run of the tests:

	npm run test

This will run both the unit tests, and the integration tests.
Testing will fail if any of the tests do not adhere to the styleguide.

To only run unit tests:

	npm run test:unit:single

To run only the integration tests:

	npm run test:inte:single

To rebuild the tests on changes, remove `:single`.
For example:

	npm run test:unit

=== Typescript

This project uses link:http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/home.html[Typescript].
As such if a package is added that does not include a type definition file, the types must be added as a dependency as well.
This can be determined if:

* An editor complains it cannot find types for `<package>`.
* The installed package does not have a type definition at its root.
The type definition file has a `.d.ts` suffix.
* Typescript throws a compilation error complaining that `<package> is implicitly of type any`.

To install types for a package:

	yarn add --dev @types/<package>

Where `<package>` is the name of the package.

== Building for Production

To build for production:

	npm run build

To serve the files, `http-server` can be installed via:

	yarn global add http-server

and the files served using:

	http-server dist/ -p 8080

== Configuration

Configuration for the agriboard server is done in the `config` directory using javascript files.
A different file exists for each environment.
